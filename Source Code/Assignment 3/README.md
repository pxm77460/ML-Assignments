## Short Description:  
### 1. Numpy:
a. Using NumPy create random vector of size 15 having only Integers in the range 1-20.

In this question, we use the numpy library to create a random vector of size 15 with integer elements in the range of 1 to 20. The random integers are generated using the randint method from numpy.  
b. Reshape the array to 3 by 5

In this question, we use the reshape method from numpy to reshape the previously generated random vector of size 15 to a 3x5 matrix.  
c. Replace the max in each row by 0

In this question, we use the where and amax methods from numpy to replace the maximum element in each row of a 3x5 matrix with 0.  
d. Create a 2-dimensional array of size 4 x 3 (composed of 4-byte integer elements), also print the shape, type and data type of the array.

In this question, we create a 2-dimensional array of size 4x3 with integer elements using numpy. We then use the shape, type, and dtype methods to print the shape, type, and data type of the array respectively.  
e. Write a program to compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given square array given below: [[ 3 -2] [ 1 0]]

In this question, we use the eig method from numpy.linalg library to compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a given square array. The eig method returns two outputs, the eigenvalues and the right eigenvectors.  
f. Compute the sum of the diagonal element of a given array. [[0 1 2] [3 4 5]]

In this question, we use the trace method from numpy to compute the sum of diagonal elements of a given array. The trace method computes the sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix.  
g. Write a NumPy program to create a new shape to an array without changing its data.

In this question, we use the reshape method from numpy to reshape an existing array to a new shape without changing its data.

### 2. Matplotlib:
a. Write a Python programming to create a below chart of the popularity of programming Languages.  

In this question, we use the matplotlib library to create a chart that displays the popularity of programming languages. The chart is created using the pie method from pyplot, and the labels and percentages are added using the label and autopct arguments respectively. The explode argument is used to separate a section of the chart.
