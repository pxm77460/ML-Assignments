## Short Description:  
### 1. Clustering & Dimensionality reduction:  
 


1.Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying the most important variables and creating new variables that capture the most variability in the data.  
2.In the CC dataset, PCA was performed and k-means clustering was applied on the PCA result. The silhouette score improved after applying PCA.  
3.Scaling, PCA, and k-means were performed on the CC dataset, resulting in a silhouette score of 38%.  
4.The pd_speech_features.csv dataset was used, and scaling and PCA (k=3) were performed. SVM was used to report performance.  
5.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied on the Iris.csv dataset to reduce the dimensionality of data to k=2.  
6.PCA and LDA are both dimensionality reduction techniques, but PCA is unsupervised and aims to maximize variance, while LDA is supervised and aims to maximize the separation between classes.
