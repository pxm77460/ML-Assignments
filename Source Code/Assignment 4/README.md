## Short Description:  
### 1. Pandas:  
 

In this assignment, various concepts of data analysis and machine learning have been explored using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The assignment covered a range of topics including data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

In the first section, pandas library was used to read a CSV file, perform statistical analysis on the data, check for null values, and filter data based on certain conditions. Visualizations such as scatter plots were also created to show correlations between different features of the data.

In the second section, the Titanic dataset was used to explore the correlation between the target column (survived) and the sex column using correlation coefficients and visualizations. Naive Bayes was then implemented to predict survival based on various features of the data, achieving a high accuracy rate.

### 2.  Scikit library:  
In the third section, the glass dataset was used to explore the correlation between different features of the data and visualizations were created to represent these correlations. Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms were implemented to classify the glass samples into different classes, with Naive Bayes outperforming SVM in terms of accuracy.
