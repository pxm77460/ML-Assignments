### Student Id: 700747746
### Name: Pavankalyan Magam
### CRN: 23921
### University Of Central Missouri


## Short Description: 
In Machine Learning Assignment 1, the primary focus was on utilizing various data structures in Python such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These data structures were utilized to store and manipulate data in order to perform calculations.  

Created lists using square brackets[], tuples using parenthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. Used many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. And also calculated different Geometric and Statistics Calculations. And also utilized Escape Sequence characters and String Formatting to display the data.  

Implemented KNN Classifier Algorithm and also calculated Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity.

# ML Assignment 2
## Student Details:
### Student Id: 700747746
### Name: Pavankalyan Magam
### CRN: 23921
### University Of Central Missouri


## Short Description:  
In Machine Learning Assignment 2 implemented the following,  
1.Star Pattern: The program will use a for loop to generate a star pattern. The exact pattern to be displayed will depend on the specific implementation of the code.

2.Odd Index Elements: Given a list of elements, the program will use looping to extract elements that are present at odd indices. These elements will then be displayed as the output.

3.Type of List Elements: The program will take a list as input and then append the type of each element in the list to a new list. The newly created list of element types will then be displayed as the output.

4.Unique List: The program will take a list as input and return a new list that contains only the unique elements of the original list. This is achieved by removing any duplicates from the original list.

5.Character Count: The program will accept a string as input and calculate the number of upper-case and lower-case letters in the string. The number of upper-case and lower-case letters will be displayed as the output.

# ML Assignment 4
## Student Details:
### Student Id: 700747746
### Name: Pavankalyan Magam
### CRN: 23921
### University Of Central Missouri


## Short Description:  
### 1. Pandas:  
 

In this assignment, various concepts of data analysis and machine learning have been explored using the pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The assignment covered a range of topics including data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling.

In the first section, pandas library was used to read a CSV file, perform statistical analysis on the data, check for null values, and filter data based on certain conditions. Visualizations such as scatter plots were also created to show correlations between different features of the data.

In the second section, the Titanic dataset was used to explore the correlation between the target column (survived) and the sex column using correlation coefficients and visualizations. Naive Bayes was then implemented to predict survival based on various features of the data, achieving a high accuracy rate.

### 2.  Scikit library:  
In the third section, the glass dataset was used to explore the correlation between different features of the data and visualizations were created to represent these correlations. Naive Bayes and SVM algorithms were implemented to classify the glass samples into different classes, with Naive Bayes outperforming SVM in terms of accuracy.
