## Short Description: 
In Machine Learning Assignment 1, the primary focus was on utilizing various data structures in Python such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. These data structures were utilized to store and manipulate data in order to perform calculations.  

Created lists using square brackets[], tuples using parenthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. Used many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. And also calculated different Geometric and Statistics Calculations. And also utilized Escape Sequence characters and String Formatting to display the data.  

Implemented KNN Classifier Algorithm and also calculated Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity.
